# This Project include 3 parts:
* An unsupervised anomaly detection in an unlabelled data which includes values of current of 3 phase motor
  * The colab notebook is attached for the model used for detecting the anomaly
    * Unsupervised Machine Learning - K Means and
    * Unsupervised Deep Learning - AutoEncoder
* Dockerized Code
  * DockerFile is attached in this repository

* TDD testing
  * In the last part of the notebook - The Autoencoder is able to detect the anomaly in the dataset - recognizing the pattern
