# This Project include 3 parts:
* An unsupervised anomaly detection in an unlabelled data which includes values of current of 3 phase motor
  * The colab notebook is attached for the model used for detecting the anomaly
    * Unsupervised Machine Learning - K Means and
    * Unsupervised Deep Learning - AutoEncoder
  * if want to see the notebook directly on github - please refer to the link - "https://github.com/Rdk-L/100DaysPytthon/blob/master/Anomaly_Detection_3phasemotor.ipynb"

* Dockerized Code
  * DockerFile is attached in this repository

* TDD testing
  * In the last part of the notebook - The Autoencoder is able to detect the anomaly in the dataset - recognizing the pattern
