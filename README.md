#This Project include 3 parts:
*An unsupervised anomaly detection in an unlabelled data which includes values of current of 3 phase motor
  *The colab notebook is attached for the model used for detecting the anomaly
    *Unsupervised Machine Learning - K Means and
    *Unsupervised Deep Learning - AutoEncoder
*Dockerized Code
  *DockerFile is attached in this repository

*TDD testing
  *In the last part of the notebook - The Autoencoder is able to detect the anomaly in the dataset - recognizing the pattern
